# CEDEX Coin Smart Contract
## Overview
CEDEX is the First Ever Certified Blockchain Based Diamond Exchange

CEDEX.com is a global exchange that focuses on bridging the gap between the traditional diamond industry and the innovative financial markets. With its extensive industry knowledge, CEDEX wants to engineer a ground-breaking change – enabling people to liquidate and invest in diamonds like any other financial asset, in a transparent and secure way.

The CEDEX exchange enables anyone to invest in individual diamonds, shares of a high- value stone or shares in a basket of diamonds (ETF).

Investors, buyers and sellers are confident because the diamond value is transparent, using the DEX, our machine learning algorithm and blockchain technology that rates a diamond’s asking price, liquid because it creates a two- sided market by enhancing both the supply and demand, and fungible because CEDEX creates a unique benchmark value, rate and contract for every stone.

CEDEX was founded by a group of experienced veterans from the FinTech, diamond, financial and online industries, all of whom have extensive industry knowledge.

Become part of one of the most revolutionary changes in the financial industry in centuries – enabling people to finally invest in diamonds like any other commodity.
